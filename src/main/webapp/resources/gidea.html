<h1>gidea.css Style Sheet Info</h1>

  <div class="plainContainer">

  <hr/>

  <h3>table.artists</h3>

  Used to create the stripy table when listing only <a href="../listMusic.do">artists</a>

  <hr/>

  <h3>table.album, td.cover, td.tracks, td.backup</h3>
  Used to layout stuff when looking at an artist or a single album


  <hr/>

  <h3>div.cover</h3>
  This is bad having two styles with the same name, one used as a td, the other as a div.
  <br/>
  This one is used when displaying an album cover - its for the set of covers at
  the bottom which doesn't get printed.

  <hr/>

  <h3>table.thumbnails</h3>

  Used by the image and video apps to layout the thumbnail images.
  <table class="thumbnails">
  <tr>
    <td>One</td>
    <td>Two</td>
    <td>Three</td>
    <td>Four</td>
  </tr>
  </table>



  <hr/>

  <h3>a.tumbnail img</h3>

  Used to ensure no padding around thumnail images (which are always links).



  <hr/>

  <h3>imageNavigation</h3>

  Posistions the navigation elements in the top right of the window.
  Makes the links have large underlines (using a border).
  <br/>
  <a href="../showImage.do?path=%2Fphotos%2F2005+Algarve%2Fimg_1910.jpg">Example</a>


  <hr/>

  <h3>table.image</h3>

  Positions images in the center of the screen - seems odd!

  <hr/>

  <h3>warning</h3>

  Used as a span to highlight text. Currently only used to hightlight albums which have not been backed up,
  on the <a href="../plainMusicCatalog.do">plain music catalogue</a>. Perhaps this should be moved into
  global.
