onloadnotifier js error

full size images don't break the layout - instead the white box is outside of the container
This also means that the folder navigation won't be out wide.

Add ajax (or plain js) to show larger versions from the thumbnail page.
  Links to Set Default and Full Size from there too.
  Can use "," and "." or buttons to move forwards/backwards through a directory.
  So these shortcuts cannot be used to move to the next directory. 

Choose what is the default view - maybe the thumbnail view!

Do music using the same system.
Delete video - I don't use it anyway.
Delete Actions.
Delete model.Preferences

Move some of the styles from root to gidea???

Test an image, and/or a directory with a single quote. The prev/next preview links won't work??  

Installation
============

Ensure rootwebapp, webwidgets are updated at the same time.

Ensure 3rdParty links don't use home dir version.
